## How to Install and Run the Project

To install your project, you will need to set up the Apache server (using XAMPP or a similar package), MySQL DBMS, and PHP. Here's a brief guide on how to install these components:

Apache Server (XAMPP):

Download XAMPP from the official website: https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html
Run the XAMPP installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
Choose the components to install (Apache, MySQL, PHP, and phpMyAdmin).
Select the installation directory (e.g., C:\xampp) and complete the installation process.
MySQL DBMS:

During the XAMPP installation, MySQL will be automatically installed. No further steps are required for the basic setup.
If you prefer to install MySQL separately, you can download it from the official website: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/
Follow the MySQL installation instructions for your operating system.
PHP:

XAMPP comes with PHP installed, so no additional installation steps are needed.
If you prefer to install PHP separately, you can download it from the official PHP website: https://www.php.net/downloads.php
Follow the PHP installation instructions for your operating system.
Once you have successfully installed XAMPP (which includes Apache, MySQL, and PHP), you can proceed with setting up your Learning Management System project:

-  Clone or download your project's repository from GitHub.
-  Place the project files inside the appropriate directory (e.g., C:\xampp\htdocs for XAMPP).
-  Launch XAMPP and start the Apache and MySQL services.
-  Open a web browser and visit http://localhost or http://localhost/your-project-folder to access your project.
-  Import the provided database schema using a tool like phpMyAdmin or the MySQL command-line interface.
